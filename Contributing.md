# Contributing
Hi there! We are thrilled that you would like to contribute to GuardX. Contributions are always welcome, both reporting issues and submitting pull requests!

## Reporting issues
- Please make sure to include any potentially useful information in the issue, so we can pinpoint the issue faster without going back and forth.

## Contributing a change
- Contributions to this project are released to the public under the project's opensource license. By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). The DCO was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, wrote or otherwise have the legal right to contribute those changes.
- Contributors must sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to all commit messages with an email address that matches the commit author:

```
feat: this is my commit message

Signed-off-by: John Doe Developer <johndoe@some.example.org>
```

Use git's -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

- If you plan to work on something major, please open an issue to discuss the design first.
- Don't break backwards compatibility. If you really have to, open an issue to discuss this first.
- Add tests that cover the changes you made. Make sure to run make test
